## Data Engineering Fundamentals
### Types of Data

1. Structured Data 
    - Data is organized in defined manner(rows and columns of well defined data) or schema found in RDS.
    - Characteristics:
        - Easily queryable
        - Organized in rows and columns
        - Has a consistent structure
    - Examples:
        - CSV with consistent columns
        - RDS Database tables(MySQL, Oracle, Postgres SQL)
        - Excel Spreadsheets
2. UnStructured Data 
    - Data is does not have a predifined structured or schema.
    - Characteristics:
        - Not Easy to query
        - comes without preprocessing
        - May come in various formats
    - Examples:
        - Text files without a fixed format(log files, emails,config files), Videos , Audios, Images
        - Need indexing to extract information
3. Semi-Structured Data 
    - Data is not as organized or structured but does have some structure in form of tags,patterns,hierarchies.
    - Structure is in there  
    - Characteristics:
        - Elements might be tagged or categorized in some way
        - More flexible that Structured Data and less chaotic than UnStructured data
        - May come in various formats
    - Examples:
        - XML, JSON, Email headers, log files

### Properties of Data
1. Volume: Refers to the vast amount of data generated, stored, and processed. Big Data is characterized by large datasets that traditional systems can't handle.
    - may range from gb's to petabytes or more
    - Example: Social media platforms like Facebook generate billions of user interactions, comments, and posts daily.
    - Scale: Petabytes (1 PB = 1,000 TB) or Exabytes (1 EB = 1,000 PB)

2. Velocity: Represents the high speed at which data is generated, processed, and analyzed. Big Data is often real-time or near-real-time.
    - IoT sensor data, High freq trading systems
    - Speed: Milliseconds, seconds, or minutes

3. Variety: Indicates the diverse types of data structures, formats, and sources. Big Data includes structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
    - Example: IoT devices generate diverse data types, such as temperature, location, and sensor readings.
    - Types: Structured (e.g., databases), Semi-structured (e.g., XML), Unstructured (e.g., images)

4. Veracity: Concerns the accuracy, quality, and trustworthiness of the data. Big Data often has inconsistencies, errors, and noise.
    - Example: Sensor data from industrial equipment may be noisy or inaccurate due to hardware malfunctions.
    - Quality: Accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability

5. Value: Refers to the usefulness and relevance of the data in driving business decisions, insights, and outcomes.
    - Example: Analyzing customer purchase history and behavior to offer personalized recommendations.
    - Relevance: Business insights, decision-making, and revenue growth

6. Vigilance: Emphasizes the need for constant monitoring, security, and governance to ensure data quality, privacy, and compliance.
    - Example: Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive customer data from cyber threats.
    - Governance: Data privacy, security, compliance, and auditability
